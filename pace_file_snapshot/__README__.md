This is a snapshot of what PACE folder would look like in the middle of the research... The code files were slightly changed from the original ones (in the root folder of this repo), such as inclusions of data folders that exists on PACE. It also includes the PBS files that you would generate and submit.

Note that the actual PACE folder also contains many .out files (printed task outputs for each PBS script) and .npy files (intermediate data records that were generated when running the code for debugging). They weren't included here because 1) they're reproducible, and 2) they're huge.
